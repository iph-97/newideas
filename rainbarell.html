                <p class = "idea-content">
                    The City of Chicago estimates that approximately 29,000 gallons of water becomes roof runoff from a typical Chicago roof every year.<sup>1</sup> Given Chicago's history of flooding challenges, particularly affecting low-income and minority communities, there is a strong need to determine how to redirect water runoff. Rain barrels are one piece of addressing the challenges posed by water risk mitigation and increasing awareness of the issue.  Local flooding is particularly high in pockets of West and South-side neighborhoods, but developers do not have an economic incentive to control rainfall on their sites in these neighborhoods. Cook County residents have access to rain barrels through the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD) for around $50, but utilization for the program is quite low due to mistrust with prior programs and the associated cost. A prior program attempted to incentivize use but failed during implementation due to a lack of technical assistance and support. With disparities in urban flooding affecting communities, developers have low market incentive to work towards solutions in the places that most need it and are most affected by basement backup and local flooding.<sup>2</sup>

                    HOW IT WORKS

                <p class = "idea-content">
                    The solution offers a public/private partnership between the City, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, a philanthropic funder, and developers, to create a <b>free re-pilot program for rainwater barrel installation</b> in the Brighton Park neighborhood coupled with an <b>educational awareness campaign.</b> This partnership would offer rain barrels and installations at no cost to families in a targeted Chicago neighborhood. The targeted approach is intended to support a community that disproportionately floods: Brighton Park has an estimated 89.2% of residents that are African American or Hispanic, with 6,309 properties facing the potential of a once in a 100-year flood and a median household income below the national level.<sup>3</sup>                    
                </p>   
                <p class = "idea-content">
                    The rainwater barrel installation program will work with local organizations in the community such as the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, CEDA Brighton Park, and SGA Brighton Park to provide education and resources for the re-pilot program. A member of the City’s Sustainability team will operate as a liaison between the City, the neighborhood organizations, neighborhood developers, and MWRD as the re-pilot is put into action. MWRD and the City will also work to develop a website for technical assistance guidelines and support structures. Developers will be invited and encouraged to attend these conversations and educational sessions with local neighborhood organizations to increase trust and open dialogue. Data will be collected on use, installation, and response rate to challenges, which will be used to improve and adjust the program as needed.
