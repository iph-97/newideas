            Fellows,
        </p>

        <p class = "page-content">
            Congratulations on working in the summer of the comeback! This summer staff returned to the office, things started to open back up in and around City Hall, and many residents have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine. This has certainly been a better summer for all of us. You have all done an amazing job this summer and have all gone the extra mile. You are all some of the brightest and most intelligent individuals who we have enjoyed getting to know this summer.
        </p>

        <p class = "page-content">
            You have worked on a wide range of exciting and important projects over the past eleven weeks. You assisted with the federal priorities through organizing budget engagement sessions for the American Rescue Plan and building out our federal policy advocacy agenda. You supported the City’s equity work through engaging departments in creating Equity Action Plans, conducting policy research for the Equitable Transit-Oriented Development plan, and working on equity-focused safety and violence reduction initiatives. From assessing capital needs at homeless shelters, to advancing fines and fees reform, to supporting the City’s digital communications strategy, to bringing resources and activities to different communities through On the Block, your work has truly made a difference for Chicago’s residents. 
        </p>

        <p class = "page-content">
            The New Ideas, found in this website should be considered for implementation by the City of Chicago. We hope that as you look back on your time in the Mayor’s Office, you realize how much the many projects you worked on and your new and innovative ideas presented in this book will continue to move the city forward. 
        </p>

        <p class = "page-content">
            We are all very proud of you for completing one of the most demanding programs in the country. The work you have all done by far exceeded our expectations. You offered diligent and thoughtful work, and were always willing to step in and help with any situation. Your time spent with the Commissioners through our Speakers Series went very well and you all asked thoughtful questions that the Commissioners enjoyed answering. Through all the Talks and Tours you saw firsthand how things get done in each department and how they work together.
        </p>

        <p class = "page-content">
            We hope that your time here has been an experience that you will never forget. You have been an exceptional group with so much talent. We have all enjoyed having you here and working with you this summer, and we know that you will continue to excel in all that you do and succeed in your future endeavors.
