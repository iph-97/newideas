The Mayor’s Office Fellowship Program is the premier opportunity for bright, motivated, and civic-minded graduate students from all disciplines to apply their coursework to the greatest municipal laboratory in the world: the City of Chicago. Fellows serve the people of Chicago by supporting policy, legislative, data, communications, and public engagement initiatives within city government. By working hand-in-hand with senior staff in the Office of the Mayor and leaders from various departments and sister agencies throughout the City, Fellows deliver recommendations and implement programs that improve the lives of Chicago’s 2.7 million residents. The New Ideas Presentation is the culmination of this Fellowship, now in digital form.
