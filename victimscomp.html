                    WHY IT MATTERS

                <p class = "idea-content">
                    Illinois recently expanded eligibility for direct compensation for individuals and their loved ones who are impacted by serious violent crime.<sup>1</sup> Victims’ Compensation (CVC) is a valuable and highly underutilized resource. As little as 2% of serious violent crimes in Chicago result in an application for Crime Victim Compensation.<sup>2</sup> Low application rates are a missed opportunity for Chicagoans to access financial support in times of great need. What’s more, adequate and timely financial support can help prevent survivors from being pulled into cycles of violence and prevent future violence from occurring and CVC funds are a rich opportunity to build trust between residents, law enforcement and government institutions. This proposal aims to 1) improve CPD victim notification processes, 2) create a survivors’ resource hub on Chicago.gov, and 3) create an automated text reminder system to help residents navigate the CVC application process.

                    HOW IT WORKS
                </h4>

                <p class = "idea-content">
                    The Chicago Police Department should redesign its information notice that is provided to victims of crime. Law enforcement are often the first, and sometimes only, contact individuals have after experiencing violence. While CPD recently updated their directive for Crime Victim Assistance (Special Order S02-01-03), the paper information notices given to residents at the time of victimization are cluttered, confusing, and easily lost.      
                </p>
                <p class = "idea-content"> 
                    By redesigning the Victim Information Notice using behavioral design principles, residents may better understand the steps necessary to ensure eligibility for CVC. This redesign would:       
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        put the most important information at the top 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        clearly communicate the opportunity to access CVC using encouraging yet realistic language;  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        include a link to a city website where individuals can access additional resources (including resources beyond CVC, assistance for non-CVC eligible costs, and support to cover gaps during long-waiting periods of CVC application review). 
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class = "idea-content">
                    A resource hub site will make the same info readily available even if someone loses the physical victim notification form and allow survivors to opt-in to automated text reminders to guide them through the victims’ compensation process — for example a reminder to file a police report within 72 hours, a reminder to file their application within 2 years etc. Each text will include information for the state-wide crime victims’ hotline so this intervention will not require additional city staff to respond to inquiries.    
                </p>
                <p class = "idea-content">
                    COST: A New York City program which sent automated texts to remind residents to appear in court cost only $0.00075 per message. If successful, this approach could be adapted to expand access to provide a cost-effective pathway to assisting Chicagoans in a time of great need.
