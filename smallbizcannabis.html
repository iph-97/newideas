                <p class = "idea-content">
                    Illinois State-level recreational cannabis licensing legislation seeks to provide access to a growing cannabis industry to communities and individuals disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs.  Small businesses will face competition from well-funded, multi-state operators. A delay in State licensing due to litigation, lottery, and scoring issues has already cost applicants time, resources, capital, and revenue. To support Social Equity Applicants (SEA), fortify them against buyouts, and best enable their success, the City should promote support services in the following categories:  tax, legal, financial, general business support, and marketing.

                <p class = "idea-content">
                    The City’s Office of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) provides resources, support, and monitoring to businesses it licenses, but the cannabis industry in Chicago is dependent on State licensing which limits BACP’s connection to, authority over, and funding for cannabis business resources. SEAs’ primary City interactions will be with the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA).

                    The BACP can promote already available resources to SEA businesses through collaboration with the ZBA. BACP can provide access to the following general supports for small cannabis businesses:            
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The Neighborhood Business Development Center which provides grants to 65 business service organizations that assist business owners

                        <li>

                        <li>

                <p class = "idea-content">
                    To ensure SEAs gain access to resources already built into this system, BACP and ZBA should collaborate on promoting these resources during SEA interactions with the City during the zoning process.

                    The City should consider deploying its robust media and public information department to organize cannabis-specific business resource fairs and events.

                    Finally, the City should consider 1) hiring a project coordinator for new and emerging fields who can support additional programming and 2) SEA-specific ordinances in Chicago, modeled after California’s local equity assistance ordinances.<sup>1</sup> For example, San Jose’s ordinance provides funding for technical assistance and training for prospective employees.<sup>2</sup> These initiatives can be funded from the cannabis revenue’s general corporate fund.
